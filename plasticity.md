Some definition from [Artificial Evolution of Plastic Neural Network : a Few Key Concepts](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01300702/document)
and [NonSynaptic Plasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonsynaptic_plasticity)

<code>**Hebb's rule**</code> : neurons that fire together, wire together.

<code>**Structural plasticity**</code> : the mechanism describing a generation of new connections and thereby redefining
the topology of the network.

<code>**Synaptic plasticity**</code> : the mechanism of changing strength values of existing connections.

<code>**Non-Synaptic Plasticity**</code> : modification of intrinsic excitability of the neuron.
Excitatory postSynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and Inhibitory postSynaptic potentials (IPSPs).
