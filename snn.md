# Spiking Neural Network and Image Classification
In this blog post we will see in detail (language information, visual information, python code information)
how to implement in python a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) that perform image classification using unsupervised learning algorithm
(Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity) and supervised one (R-STDP).
